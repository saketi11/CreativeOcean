			<h2>INSPIRATION:</h2>
			<p>Inspiration can come from everyone or everything in any time.

			<h2>PHOTOGRAPHY:</h2>
			<p>Most people think they just need a professional full-frame DSLR camera, put it on 'Auto', fire the shutter and BOOOOM they are photographers....that makes me laugh!<br>The truth is to be a professional photographer first you must learn a lot, in the other hand all that could be useless if you don't have the <abbr title="The 'EYE' refers to the ability to capture a moment in a photographical masterpiece">'EYE'</abbr> for the picture.</p>

			<h2>GRAPHICAL DESIGN:</h2>
			<p>Colors, shapes, shadows,...and many more combined all together to one called Graphical Design.<br>This is pure art, the art of creating thousand words worth in single image or a logo or templet! No one can even imagine the limits...<br>This is the art of 21<sup>st</sup> century, instead of canvas using computers, instead of brushes using softwares, but the artist is the SAME!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="nine smalls">
			<h2>MUSIC:</h2>
			<p>As the focus is on Modern Art surely this section is about <abbr title="Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments, digital instruments and circuitry-based music technology">Electronic Music</abbr>.
